## Aim
This is an interactive game designed to challenge your mind, test your focus, and promote positive thinking. Get ready to embark on an exciting journey of self-discovery and skill development through engaging gameplay!

## How to Play
- **Main Menu**: Start your adventure from the main menu, where you can begin your journey.
- **The Quiz**: Begin by answering a series of 6 questions. Based on your answers, you will be assigned one of three mini-games tailored to a specific skill or mindset.
- **The Mini-Games**: Each mini-game focuses on a unique theme: positive thinking, breathing rhythm, or concentration.

## Mini-Games Overview
1. **The Maze**:
    _Theme_: Positive Thinking
    _Objective_: Navigate through a maze while breaking "stones of negativity" along the way.
    _Challenge_: Stay focused on the positive as you clear your path and reach the exit.

2. **The Forest**
    _Theme_: Breathing Rhythm
    _Objective_: Walk across a rope by synchronizing your movements with your breathing.
    _How to Play_:
        Walk forward while inhaling.
        Stop moving while exhaling.
    _Challenges_:
        If you move while the "breathing bar" is descending, you’ll fall and restart.
        Avoid obstacles like birds—touching one will make you fall and restart.

4. **The Swamp**
    _Theme_: Concentration
    _Objective_: Cross the swamp by jumping onto stones. Some stones are stable, while others will sink.
    _Challenge_: Memorize the stable path and concentrate to avoid falling.

Unfortunately we didn't have enough time to fix the Swamp minigame. So that game doesn't work right now.
