## Aim
This is an interactive game designed to challenge your mind, test your focus, and promote positive thinking. Get ready to embark on an exciting journey of self-discovery and skill development through engaging gameplay!

## How to Play
- Main Menu: Start your adventure from the main menu, where you can begin your journey.
- The Quiz: Begin by answering a series of 6 questions. Based on your answers, you will be assigned one of three mini-games tailored to a specific skill or mindset.
- The Mini-Games: Each mini-game focuses on a unique theme: positive thinking, breathing rhythm, or concentration.

## Mini-Games Overview
1. The Maze:
    Theme: Positive Thinking
    Objective: Navigate through a maze while breaking "stones of negativity" along the way.
    Challenge: Stay focused on the positive as you clear your path and reach the exit.

2. The Forest 
    Theme: Breathing Rhythm
    Objective: Walk across a rope by synchronizing your movements with your breathing.
    How to Play:
        Walk forward while inhaling.
        Stop moving while exhaling.
    Challenges:
        If you move while the "breathing bar" is descending, you’ll fall and restart.
        Avoid obstacles like birds—touching one will make you fall and restart.

3. The Swamp
    Theme: Concentration
    Objective: Cross the swamp by jumping onto stones. Some stones are stable, while others will sink.
    Challenge: Memorize the stable path and concentrate to avoid falling.
